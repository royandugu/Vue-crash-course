Basically the template as far as I know is
<script>
    ... this is where the js logic is 
</script>

<template>
    ... this is where our HTML is the markup
</template>

<style>
    ... this is where our CSS lies
</style>

Aba hamro style mah scoped vanne pani rakhna milxa, what that does is that suppose yo mathi ko jun script template style haru euta component mah xa vane, hamile ekaichoti h1 laii style diyo vane aru component mah vayeko h1 laii style nalagos tara yeslai matra lagos vanna lai we use scoped.
